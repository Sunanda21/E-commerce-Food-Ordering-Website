# E-commerce-Food-Ordering-Website

1. Core Features: Developed a comprehensive e-commerce platform enabling users to
   browse food items, register/log in, add items to the cart, and complete transactions with
   options for PayPal and Cash on Delivery (COD). Integrated user-specific functionalities
   including logout and order tracking.
 
2. Admin Panel: Implemented an admin panel for product management, order processing,
   and user activity monitoring using PHP CRUD operations. This feature offers an intuitive
   interface for administrators to efficiently manage backend tasks.
   
4. Technologies and Design: Utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a
   responsive and engaging design. Employed AJAX for smooth, asynchronous updates,
   while PHP and MySQL handled server-side processing and database interactions. Used
   PHPMyAdmin for database management, and applied session variables to securely
   manage user sessions.
   
5. Security and Data Management: Applied addslashes() function to prevent SQL injection
   and ensure data protection. The project involved extensive image integration and data
   collection to improve user experience and operational efficiency.
